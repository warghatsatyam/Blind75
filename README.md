# 🧠 Blind 75 LeetCode Challenge – 90 Days War Mode

Welcome to my curated **Blind 75 LeetCode Tracker** — a focused effort to level up my Data Structures and Algorithms skills and become a stronger software engineer.

Over the next 90 days, I'm dedicating time daily to sharpen my problem-solving, strengthen interview readiness, and explore patterns that appear in real-world tech interviews.

This repository contains clean, well-documented solutions to the essential **Blind 75** problems — widely regarded as the foundational set for coding interviews at top companies.

Let’s grow, one problem at a time 💪

## 📍 Why I'm Doing This

I'm on a mission to:
- Sharpen my problem-solving & DSA fundamentals
- Crack mid-to-senior dev interviews at top product/startup companies
- Build consistency, clarity, and confidence in interviews

This repo = my public commitment to growth 💪
