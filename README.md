# 🧠 Blind 75 LeetCode Challenge – 90 Days War Mode

Welcome to my personal **Blind 75 LeetCode Tracker**, part of my 90-day war mode mission to 3x my salary and become a world-class developer.

This repository contains my curated solutions to the famous **Blind 75** list — a set of the most essential coding problems asked in top tech interviews.

## 📍 Why I'm Doing This

I'm on a mission to:
- Sharpen my problem-solving & DSA fundamentals
- Crack mid-to-senior dev interviews at top product/startup companies
- Build consistency, clarity, and confidence in interviews

This repo = my public commitment to growth 💪
